# rundown
The rundown of (a) scenarios provoking issues in spatial causal inference, (b) existing spatial causal models, and (c) the matrix of applications of members of (b) on members of (a).

## Data scenarios

### Confounding
- spatially autocorrelated treatment
- spatially autocorrelated outcome
- spatially autocorrelated confounders

### Interference
First one definitely exists. Do the others exist too?
- treatment at one location influences outcomes at others
- treatment at one location influences treatment at others (?)
- treatment at one location influences confounders at others (?)

### Mixtures
Combinations of spatial autocorrelation and treatment interference.

## Existing spatial causal models
- 

## Existing nonspatial causal models

(for comparison to the spatial ones)
